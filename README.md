# Motia Examples 🚀

Welcome to the official examples repository for [Motia](https://motia.dev/) - a modern backend framework for building event-driven applications with built-in observability and state management.

## 🤔 How it Works

Motia uses **Steps** as its core primitive. Steps can be:
- **API Steps** (`api`) - HTTP endpoints for REST/GraphQL APIs
- **Event Steps** (`event`) - Background workers triggered by events
- **Cron Steps** (`cron`) - Scheduled tasks that run automatically

Each Step has access to:
- **State Management** - Traced key-value store shared across steps
- **Event System** - Emit and subscribe to decouple your logic
- **Observability** - Built-in tracing and structured logging

A single Motia app can replace multiple tools like Nest.js, Temporal, and Celery/BullMQ - it's all just steps and events.
