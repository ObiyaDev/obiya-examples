- `serveCss`: Serves stylesheet for the UI
- `serveStatic`: Serves static files for the UI

### Analysis Pipeline
- `extractText`: Extracts text from paper (simulated in this demo)
- `analyzePaper`: Performs initial analysis using Gemini 2.5 Pro
- `analyzePaperWithGemini`: Enhances analysis with structured information
- `generateSummary` & `generateSummaryWithGemini`: Creates concise, well-structured summaries
- `extractConcepts` & `extractConceptsWithGemini`: Identifies key concepts with descriptions

The implementation uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model for all AI tasks, with robust error handling and case-insensitive key processing to ensure reliability. The knowledge graph is stored using file-based persistence in a JSON file, making it accessible across different steps and API endpoints.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- Google API Key for Gemini 2.5 Pro

### Environment Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MotiaDev/motia-examples.git
   cd motia-examples/examples/research-assistant
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your Google API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the Motia server:

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### Upload a Paper
```http
POST /api/upload-paper
Content-Type: application/json
```

Example payload:
```json
{
  "title": "Mem0",
  "authors": "Prateek Chhikara, Dev Khant, Saket Aryan, Taranjeet Singh",
  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in generating contextually coherent responses, yet their fixed context windows pose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over prolonged multi-session dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric architecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting, consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations.",
  "pdfUrl": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19413",
  "doi": "2504.19413"
}
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Paper uploaded successfully",
  "paperId": "paper-1746292138955"
}
```

### Query Knowledge Graph
```http
GET /api/query
```

Query options:
```http
GET /api/query                           # Get all data
GET /api/query?concept=Mem0              # Query by concept
GET /api/query?paperId=paper-1746292138955  # Query by paper ID
```

### Get Paper Details
```http
GET /api/paper/:paperId
```

Example:
```http
GET /api/paper/paper-1746292138955
```

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### Using cURL

1. Upload a paper:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload-paper \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "title": "name of paper",
       "authors": "name of authors",
       "abstract": "abstract of paper",
       "pdfUrl": "url of pdf",
       "doi": "doi of paper"
     }'
   ```

2. Query the knowledge graph:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/query"
   ```

3. Query by concept:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/query?concept=Mem0"
   ```

4. Get paper details by ID:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:3000/api/paper/paper-1746292138955"
   ```

### Using JavaScript

Create a file named `test-upload.js`:

```javascript
// Simple test script for the upload-paper endpoint
// Using Node.js built-in fetch API (available in Node.js v20+)

async function testUploadPaper() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/upload-paper', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        title: 'name of paper',
        authors: 'name of authors',
        abstract: 'abstract of paper',
        pdfUrl: 'url of pdf',
        doi: 'doi of paper'
      }),
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Response:', data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

testUploadPaper();
```

Run with:
```bash
